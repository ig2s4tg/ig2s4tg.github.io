title: IDB1 and Teamwork

### What did you do this past week?
I spent most of my time last week doing the first IDB project. Even at internships, I've never worked in a group this large, so the coordination aspect was new and challenging for me.

### What's in your way?
This next week, we'll be working more on the project. My main goal will be converting static into dynamic, which I'm very confident about and was actually advocating doing from the beginning. I also have a statistics test and a scholarship due this week.

### What will you do next week?
Like I said above, I'm pretty much focusing on converting the site from serving statically to serving dynamically. And I'll be studying for tests. Also, The onboarding process has begun for my internship this summer and I've been meaning to send some emails to establish my area of work.

### What's my experience of the class?
Although it's necessary to understand underlying concepts when using tools that make them obsolete, in my opinion, we've been spending an disproportionate amount of time learning about low-level database concepts. One thing I would've like to been focusing on instead (and we might do this in the future) is data analysis with something like pandas.


### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
While I've been doing mostly back-end stuff on the project so far, I've done a bit of work on the templates because I've had experience with Jinja. I'm definitely still learning though-- I found a pretty cool feature today.

I was trying to fetch an image to display as a kind of profile picture, but in the case of some models, the image url value wasn't defined. To make sure there was always something there, I tested if the field was None (actually none, Jinja has different definitions) and assigned it a default if it was.
The code looked like this

{% if artist.image is none %}
  <img class="artist-portrait" src="/static/img/placeholder.jpg">
{% else %}
  <img class="artist-portrait" src={{artist.image}}>
{% endif %}


After some looking around, I stumbled upon another much more elegant solution

  <img class="artist-portrait" src={{artist.image}} or "/static/img/placeholder.jpg">


Jinja's 'or' keyword provides a default value in case the variable is null! I thought this was really cool and convenient; it'll cut down on the length of our templates and improve readability.
